# Software tools for metabolomics and lipidomics

## Tutorials

### [MS-FINDER](/mtbinfo.github.io/MS-FINDER/tutorial "MS-FINDER")

MS-FINDER is a universal program for compound annotation supporting EI-MS (GC/MS) and ESI-MS/MS spectra. It aims to provide solutions for 1) spectral searching, 2) formula prediction, and 3) structure elucidation for unknown spectra.

### [MS-DIAL](/mtbinfo.github.io/MS-DIAL/tutorial "MS-DIAL") 
[-- Japanese](/mtbinfo.github.io/MS-DIAL/tutorial_japanese "MS-DIAL Japan") 

MS-DIAL is a universal program for untargeted metabolomics- and lipidomics supporting any type of chromatography/mass spectrometry methods (GC/MS, GC-MS/MS, LC/MS, and LC-MS/MS etc.).

### [MRMPROBS](/mtbinfo.github.io/MRMPROBS/tutorial "MRMPROBS")

MRMPROBS is launched as a universal program for targeted metabolomics supporting not only multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) but also SCAN and data independent MS/MS acquisition (DIA) data.
